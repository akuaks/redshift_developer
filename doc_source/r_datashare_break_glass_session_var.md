## Description<a name="datashare_break_glass_session_var-description"></a>

Applies a permission that allows certain operations that generally aren't recommended for an AWS Data Exchange datashare\.

In general, we recommend that you don't drop or alter an AWS Data Exchange datashare using the DROP DATASHARE or ALTER DATASHARE SET PUBLICACCESSIBLE statement\. To allow dropping or altering an AWS Data Exchange datashare to turn off the publicly accessible setting, set the `datashare_break_glass_session_var` variable to a one\-time value\. This one\-time value is generated by Amazon Redshift and provided in an error message after the initial attempt at the operation in question\. 

After setting the variable to the one\-time generated value, run the DROP DATASHARE or ALTER DATASHARE statement again\.

For more information, see [ALTER DATASHARE usage notes](r_ALTER_DATASHARE.md#r_ALTER_DATASHARE_usage) or [DROP DATASHARE usage notes](r_DROP_DATASHARE.md#r_DROP_DATASHARE_usage)\.
