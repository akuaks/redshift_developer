# Getting started with Amazon Redshift ML<a name="getting-started-machine-learning"></a>

Amazon Redshift ML makes it easy for SQL users to create, train, and deploy machine learning models using familiar SQL commands\. With Amazon Redshift ML, you can use your data in your Redshift cluster to train model with Amazon SageMaker\. Later, the models are localized and predictions can be made within an Amazon Redshift database\. Amazon Redshift ML currently supports the machine learning algorithms XGBoost \(AUTO ON and OFF\) and multilayer perceptron \(AUTO ON\), K\-Means \(AUTO OFF\), and Linear Learner\.
