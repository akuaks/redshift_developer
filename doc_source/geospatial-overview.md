# Querying spatial data in Amazon Redshift<a name="geospatial-overview"></a>

*Spatial data* describes the position and shape of a geometry in a defined space \(a spatial reference system\)\. Amazon Redshift supports spatial data with the `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` data types, which contain spatial data and optionally the data's spatial reference system identifier \(SRID\)\. 

Spatial data contains geometric data that you can use to represent geographic features\. Examples of this type of data include weather reports, map directions, tweets with geographic positions, store locations, and airline routes\. Spatial data plays an important role in business analytics, reporting, and forecasting\. 

You can query spatial data with Amazon Redshift SQL functions\. Spatial data contains geometric values for an object\. 

The `GEOMETRY` data type operations work on the Cartesian plane\. Although the spatial reference system identifier \(SRID\) is stored inside the object, this SRID is merely an identifier of the coordinate system and plays no role in the algorithms used to process the `GEOMETRY` objects\. Conversely, the operations on the `GEOGRAPHY` data type treat the coordinates inside objects as spherical coordinates on a spheroid\. This spheroid is defined by the SRID, which references a geographic spatial reference system\. By default, `GEOGRAPHY` data types are created with spatial reference \(SRID\) 4326, referencing the World Geodetic System \(WGS\) 84\.

You can use the ST\_Transform function to transform the coordinates from various spatial reference systems\. After the transformation of the coordinates is done, you can also use a simple cast between the two, as long as the input `GEOMETRY` is encoded with the geographic SRID\. This cast simply copies coordinates without any further transformation\. For example:

```
SELECT ST_AsEWKT(ST_GeomFromEWKT('SRID=4326;POINT(10 20)')::geography);
```

```
st_asewkt
------------------------
 SRID=4326;POINT(10 20)
```

To better understand the difference between `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` data types, consider calculating the distance between the Berlin airport \(BER\) and the San Francisco airport \(SFO\) using the World Geodetic System \(WGS\) 84\. Using the `GEOGRAPHY` data type, the result is in meters\. When using `GEOMETRY` data type with SRID 4326, the result is in degrees, which canâ€™t convert to meters because the distance of one degree depends on where on the globe geometries are located\.

Calculations on the `GEOGRAPHY` data type are mostly used for realistic round earth calculations such as the precise area of a country without distortion\. But they are far more expensive to compute\. Therefore, ST\_Transform can transform your coordinates to an appropriate local projected coordinate system and do the calculation on the `GEOMETRY` data type faster\.

Using spatial data, you can run queries to do the following:
+ Find the distance between two points\.
+ Check whether one area \(polygon\) contains another\.
+ Check whether one linestring intersects another linestring or polygon\.

You can use the `GEOMETRY` data type to hold the values of spatial data\. A `GEOMETRY` value in Amazon Redshift can define two\-dimensional \(2D\), three\-dimensional \(3DZ\), two\-dimensional with a measure \(3DM\), and four\-dimensional \(4D\) geometry primitive data types:
+ A two\-dimensional \(2D\) geometry is specified by two Cartesian coordinates \(x, y\) in a plane\.
+ A three\-dimensional \(3DZ\) geometry is specified by three Cartesian coordinates \(x, y, z\) in space\.
+ A two\-dimensional with measure \(3DM\) geometry is specified by three coordinates \(x, y, m\), where the first two are Cartesian coordinates in a plane and the third is a measurement\.
+ A four\-dimensional \(4D\) geometry is specified by four coordinates \(x, y, z, m\), where the first three are Cartesian coordinates in a space and the fourth is a measurement\.

For more information about geometry primitive data types, see [Well\-known text representation of geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) in Wikipedia\.   

You can use the `GEOGRAPHY` data type to hold the values of spatial data\. A `GEOGRAPHY` value in Amazon Redshift can define two\-dimensional \(2D\), three\-dimensional \(3DZ\), two\-dimensional with a measure \(3DM\), and four\-dimensional \(4D\) geometry primitive data types:
+ A two\-dimensional \(2D\) geometry is specified by longitude and latitude coordinates on a spheroid\.
+ A three\-dimensional \(3DZ\) geometry is specified by longitude, latitude, and altitude coordinates on a spheroid\.
+ A two\-dimensional with measure \(3DM\) geometry is specified by three coordinates \(longitude, latitude, measure\), where the first two are angular coordinates on a sphere and the third is a measurement\.
+ A four\-dimensional \(4D\) geometry is specified by four coordinates \(longitude, latitude, altitude, measure\), where the first three are longitude, latitude and altitude, and the fourth is a measurement\.

The `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` data types have the following subtypes: 
+ `POINT`
+ `LINESTRING`
+ `POLYGON`
+ `MULTIPOINT`
+ `MULTILINESTRING`
+ `MULTIPOLYGON`
+ `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`

There are Amazon Redshift SQL functions that support the following representations of geometric data:
+ GeoJSON
+ Well\-known text \(WKT\) 
+ Extended well\-known text \(EWKT\)
+ Well\-known binary \(WKB\) representation 
+ Extended well\-known binary \(EWKB\)

You can cast between `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` data types\.

The following SQL casts a linestring from a `GEOMETRY` to a `GEOGRAPHY`\. 

```
SELECT ST_AsEWKT(ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(110 40, 2 3, -10 80, -7 9)')::geography);
```

```
 st_asewkt
----------------------------------------------
 SRID=4326;LINESTRING(110 40,2 3,-10 80,-7 9)
```

The following SQL casts a linestring from a `GEOGRAPHY` to a `GEOMETRY`\. 

```
SELECT ST_AsEWKT(ST_GeogFromText('LINESTRING(110 40, 2 3, -10 80, -7 9)')::geometry);
```

```
 st_asewkt
----------------------------------------------
 SRID=4326;LINESTRING(110 40,2 3,-10 80,-7 9)
```

Amazon Redshift provides many SQL functions to query spatial data\. Except for the `ST_IsValid` function, spatial functions that accept a `GEOMETRY` object as an argument expect this `GEOMETRY` object to be a valid geometry\. If the `GEOMETRY` or `GEOGRAPHY` object isn't valid, then the behavior of the spatial function is undefined\. For more information about validity, see [Geometric validity](spatial-terminology.md#spatial-terminology-validity)\.
