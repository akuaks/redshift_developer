# Data sharing concepts for Amazon Redshift<a name="concepts"></a>

Following are some data sharing terms and concepts:
+ A *datashare* is the unit of sharing data in Amazon Redshift\. Use datashares to share data in the same AWS account or different AWS accounts\. Also, share data for read purposes across different Amazon Redshift clusters\.

  Each datashare is associated with a specific database in your Amazon Redshift cluster\. 

  A cluster administrator can receive datashares from other clusters, referred to as *inbound* shares\. A cluster administrator can also create datashares to share data with other clusters, referred to as *outbound* shares\. 
+ An *AWS Data Exchange datashare* is a unit of licensing for sharing your data through AWS Data Exchange\. AWS manages all billing and payments associated with subscriptions to AWS Data Exchange and use of Amazon Redshift data sharing\. Approved data providers can add AWS Data Exchange datashares to AWS Data Exchange products\. When customers subscribe to a product with AWS Data Exchange datashares, they get access to the datashares in the product\. 

  For more information, see [Working with AWS Data Exchange for Amazon Redshift](adx-datashare.md)\.
+ *Data producers* \(also known as data sharing producers or datashare producers\) are clusters that you want to share data from\. Producer cluster administrators and database owners can create datashares using the CREATE DATASHARE command\. You can add objects such as schemas, tables, views, and SQL user\-defined functions \(UDFs\) from a database that you want the producer cluster to share with consumer clusters for read purposes\.

  Data producers \(also known as providers on AWS Data Exchange\) for AWS Data Exchange datashares can license data through AWS Data Exchange\. Approved providers can add AWS Data Exchange datashares to AWS Data Exchange products\. 

  When a customer subscribes to a product with AWS Data Exchange datashares, AWS Data Exchange automatically adds the customer as a data consumer on all AWS Data Exchange datashares included with the product\. AWS Data Exchange also removes all customers from AWS Data Exchange datashares when their subscription ends\. AWS Data Exchange also automatically manages billing, invoicing, payment collection, and payment distribution for paid products with AWS Data Exchange datashares\. For more information, see [Working with AWS Data Exchange for Amazon Redshift](adx-datashare.md)\. To register as an AWS Data Exchange data provider, see [Getting started as a provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/provider-getting-started.html)\.
+ *Data consumers* \(also known as data sharing consumers or datashare consumers\) are clusters that receive datashares from producer clusters\. 

  Amazon Redshift clusters that share data can be in the same or different AWS account or different AWS Regions, so you can share data across organizations and collaborate with other parties\. Consumer cluster administrators receive the datashares that they are granted usage for and review the contents of each datashare\. To consume shared data, the consumer cluster administrator creates an Amazon Redshift database from the datashare\. The administrator then assigns permissions for the database to users and groups in the consumer cluster\. After permissions are granted, users and groups can list the shared objects as part of the standard metadata queries, along with the local data on the consumer cluster\. They can start querying immediately\.

  If you are a *consumer with an active AWS Data Exchange subscription* \(also known as subscribers on AWS Data Exchange\), you can find, subscribe to, and query granular, up\-to\-date data in Amazon Redshift without the need to extract, transform, and load the data\. For more information, see [Working with AWS Data Exchange for Amazon Redshift](adx-datashare.md)\.
+ *Datashare objects* are objects from specific databases on a cluster that producer cluster administrators can add to datashares to be shared with data consumers\. Datashare objects are read\-only for data consumers\. Examples of datashare objects are tables, views, and user\-defined functions\. You can add datashare objects to datashares while creating datashares or editing a datashare at any time\.
+ *Provisioned cluster namespaces* are identifiers that identify Amazon Redshift clusters\. A namespace globally unique identifier \(GUID\) is automatically created during Amazon Redshift cluster creation and attached to the cluster\. A namespace Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) is in the `arn:{partition}:redshift:{region}:{account-id}:namespace:{namespace-guid}` format\. You can see the namespace of an Amazon Redshift cluster on the cluster details page on the Amazon Redshift console\. 

  In the data sharing workflow, the namespace GUID value and the cluster namespace ARN are used to share data with clusters in the AWS account\. You can also find the namespace for the current cluster by using the `current_namespace` function\.
+ *Serverless namespaces* are identifiers that identify Amazon Redshift Serverless\. A namespace globally unique identifier \(GUID\) is automatically created during Amazon Redshift Serverless creation and attached to the instance\. A serverless namespace Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) is in the `arn:{partition}:redshift-serverless:{region}:{account-id}:namespace/{namespace-guid}` format\.
+ *AWS accounts* can be consumers for datashares and are each represented by a 12\-digit AWS account ID\.
