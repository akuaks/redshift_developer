# Sharing licensed Amazon Redshift data on AWS Data Exchange<a name="adx-getting-started"></a>

When creating AWS Data Exchange datashares and adding them to an AWS Data Exchange product, providers can license data in Amazon Redshift that consumers can discover, subscribe to, and query up\-to\-date data in Amazon Redshift when they have active AWS Data Exchange subscriptions\.

With AWS Data Exchange datashares added to an AWS Data Exchange product, consumers automatically have access to a product's datashares when their subscription starts and retain their access as long as their subscription is active\.
