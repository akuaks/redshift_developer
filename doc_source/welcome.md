Welcome to the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte\-scale data warehouse service in the cloud\. Amazon Redshift Serverless lets you access and analyze data without the usual configurations of a provisioned data warehouse\. Resources are automatically provisioned and data warehouse capacity is intelligently scaled to deliver fast performance for even the most demanding and unpredictable workloads\. You don't incur charges when the data warehouse is idle, so you only pay for what you use\. Regardless of the size of the dataset, you can load data and start querying right away in the Amazon Redshift query editor v2 or in your favorite business intelligence \(BI\) tool\. Enjoy the best price performance and familiar SQL features in an easy\-to\-use, zero administration environment\.

This guide focuses on using Amazon Redshift to create and manage a data warehouse\. If you work with databases as a designer, software developer, or administrator, it gives you the information you need to design, build, query, and maintain your data warehouse\.
