# Tracking usage and auditing in data sharing in Amazon Redshift<a name="auditing"></a>

By auditing data sharing, producers can track the datashare evolution\. For example, auditing helps track when datashares are created, objects are added or removed, and permissions are granted or revoked to Amazon Redshift clusters, AWS accounts, or AWS Regions\.

In addition to auditing, producers and consumers track datashare usage at various granularities, such as account, cluster, and object levels\. For more information about tracking usage and auditing views, see [SVL\_DATASHARE\_CHANGE\_LOG](r_SVL_DATASHARE_CHANGE_LOG.md) and [SVL\_DATASHARE\_USAGE\_PRODUCER](r_SVL_DATASHARE_USAGE_PRODUCER.md)\.
