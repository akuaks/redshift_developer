# Connecting to a database<a name="connect-database-console"></a>

Connect to a database to view databases and objects within databases in this cluster or to view datashares\.

The user credentials used to connect to a specified database must have the necessary permissions to view all datashares\.

If there is no local connection, do one of the following:
+ In the cluster details page, from the **Databases** tab, in the **Databases** or **Datashare objects** section, choose **Connect to database** to view database objects in the cluster\.
+ In the cluster details page, from the **Datashares** tab, do one of the following:
  + In the **Datashares from other clusters** section, choose **Connect to database** to view datashares from other clusters\.
  + In the **Datashares created in my cluster** section, choose **Connect to database** to view datashares in your cluster\.
+ On the **Connect to database** window, do one of the following:
  + If you choose **Create a new connection**, choose **AWS Secrets Manager** to use a stored secret to authenticate access for the connection\. 

    Or, choose **Temporary credentials** to use database credentials to authenticate access for the connection\. Specify values for **Database name** and **Database user**\.

    Choose **Connect**\.
  + Choose **Use a recent connection** to connect to another database that you have the necessary permissions\.

    Amazon Redshift automatically makes the connection\.

After database connection is established, you can start creating datashares, querying datashares, or creating databases from datashares\.
