# Managing cost control for cross\-Region data sharing<a name="cross-region-billing"></a>

To share data between different AWS Regions, you pay the cross\-Region data transfer from the producer Region to the consumer Region in addition to the cost of using your Amazon Redshift cluster\. The price of data transfer is different for different Regions\. The charge is based on the bytes of data scanned for every successful query run\. For more information about Amazon Redshift pricing, see [Amazon Redshift pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/)\.

You are charged for the number of bytes, rounded up to the next megabyte, with a 10MB minimum per query\. You can set cost controls on your query usage and view the amount of data being transferred per query on your cluster\.

To monitor and control your usage and associated cost of using cross\-Region data sharing, you can create daily, weekly, monthly usage limits, and define actions that Amazon Redshift automatically takes if those limits are reached to help maintain your budget with predictability\. For more information about usage limits in Amazon Redshift, see [Managing usage limits in Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-cluster-usage-limits.html)\.

Depending on the usage limits you set, actions that Amazon Redshift takes can be to log an event to a system table, send a CloudWatch alarm and notify an administrator with an Amazon SNS, or to turn off cross\-Region data sharing for further usage\. For more information about the actions, see [Managing usage limits in Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-cluster-usage-limits.html)\.

To create usage limits in the Amazon Redshift console, choose **Configure usage limit** under **Actions** for your cluster\. You can monitor your usage trends and get alerts on usage exceeding your defined limits with automatically generated CloudWatch metrics from the **Cluster performance** or **Monitoring** tabs\. You can also create, modify, and delete usage limits programmatically by using the AWS CLI or Amazon Redshift API operations\.
